## Blackjack feedback

- On the users input I would probably try to minimize the user generated errors
by adding a "Try / Except" block. So if the input is not valid, you shouldn't 
re-start the game from scratch

- Same "Try/Except" block for the options when if playing or not 

- Would probably minimize the input options by telling the user what to input.
Maybe a single key or word.

- Also would probably define functions for "Hit", "Stay" and a variable for "Bust"
so when writing the if statements would be shorter. 

- Also maybe would be more efficient to use "r"andom choice" to get cards directly
from the dictionary than from the list. So you would be getting cards as keys and
their respective values directly. <random.choice(list(dictionary(keys)))>

- I would probably use more descriptive names. Instead of just "dealer" maybe
"dealers_hand" and instead of "i", would use "card"
